description: 'Perception can be refined by experience up to certain limits. It is
  unclear if perceptual limitations are absolute or could be partially overcome via
  enhanced neuromodulation and/or plasticity. Recent studies suggest the utility of
  peripheral nerve stimulation - specifically vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) - for
  altering neural activity and augmenting experience-dependent plasticity, although
  little is known about central mechanisms recruited by VNS. Here we developed an
  auditory discrimination task for mice implanted with a VNS electrode. VNS occurring
  during behavior gradually improved discrimination abilities beyond the level achieved
  by training alone. Using two-photon imaging, we identified changes to auditory cortical
  responses and activation of cortically-projecting cholinergic axons with VNS. Anatomical
  and optogenetic experiments indicated that VNS could enhance task performance via
  activation of the central cholinergic system. These results highlight the importance
  of cholinergic modulation for the efficacy of VNS, perhaps enabling further refinement
  of VNS methodology for clinical conditions.
